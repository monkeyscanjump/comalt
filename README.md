# Comalt Download Manager

A secure, web-based file distribution system that uses blockchain wallet authentication to manage and control access to downloads.

## Overview

Comalt Download Manager is a Next.js application that provides a secure interface for distributing files to authenticated users. It uses Polkadot/Substrate wallet signature authentication to verify user identity, with optional whitelist restrictions to control access to sensitive content.

## Features

- **Blockchain Wallet Authentication**: Secure login using Polkadot/Substrate wallet signatures
- **Whitelist Access Control**: Restrict access to specific wallet addresses
- **Public/Private Modes**: Toggle between open access and whitelist-restricted mode
- **Persistent Authentication**: JWT-based session management
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **User Management**: Admin interface for managing users and permissions
- **Download Analytics**: Track and analyze file download metrics

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Polkadot/Substrate wallet signature verification
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Database**: Prisma with your choice of database backend
- **API**: Next.js API Routes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or later
- npm or yarn
- A Polkadot/Substrate compatible wallet (like Polkadot.js extension or SubWallet)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monkeyscanjump/comalt.git
   cd comalt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Set up the database (if using Prisma):

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Environment Configuration

The application requires several environment variables to be configured:

```properties
# JWT
# Generate a secure secret with:
# Windows: powershell -c "[Convert]::ToBase64String([Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(32))"
# Unix: openssl rand -base64 32
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret"

# API Configuration
POLKADOT_API_URL=https://rpc.polkadot.io

# Public variables (accessible in browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=comalt
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# Whitelist Configuration (server-side only)
# Comma-separated list of wallet addresses that are allowed to access the app
# Leave empty for public mode (all addresses allowed)
ALLOWED_WALLETS=5FBihsF4H6PGKjnbV4R7RKqQN4abFd4AhxUNukaPvj3Susdt,second_address,third_address
```

## Application Configuration

### Default Configuration

Default configurations are located in the config directory:

- `index.ts`: Main application configuration with API endpoints, app info, and auth settings
- `whitelist.ts`: Whitelist settings and logic for access control

### Adding a New Page and Navigation

The application uses a page discovery system for automatic navigation generation:

1. **Create a Page Component**:

   Create a new file in the app directory structure, following Next.js App Router conventions:

   ```tsx
   // src/app/example/page.tsx
   "use client";

   import React from 'react';
   import { PageWrapper } from '@/components/layout/PageWrapper';
   import { FaClipboard } from 'react-icons/fa';

   export default function ExamplePage() {
     return (
       <PageWrapper
         title="Example Page"
         icon={FaClipboard}
         order={3}
       >
         <div>
           <h1>Example Page</h1>
           <p>This is an example page content.</p>
         </div>
       </PageWrapper>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Register the Page in Page Discovery**:

   Open pageDiscovery.ts and add your page to the `PAGE_REGISTRY`:

   ```typescript
   // Update the PAGE_REGISTRY object
   const PAGE_REGISTRY: Record<string, {
     title: string;
     icon: IconType;
     order: number;
     showInNav: boolean;
   }> = {
     // Core pages
     '/': {
       title: 'Dashboard',
       icon: FaHome,
       order: 10,
       showInNav: true
     },
     '/downloads': {
       title: 'Downloads',
       icon: FaDownload,
       order: 20,
       showInNav: true
     },
     '/example': {
       title: 'Example Page',
       icon: FaClipboard,
       order: 30,
       showInNav: true
     },
     // Add more pages here - they'll automatically appear in navigation
   };
   ```

3. **Page Parameters Explained**:

   - `title`: The display name shown in navigation and page header
   - `icon`: React icon component from react-icons
   - `order`: Numerical order in the navigation (lower numbers appear first)
   - `showInNav`: Whether to display this page in the navigation menu

This approach automatically updates the site navigation without requiring changes to multiple files.

### Configuring SubWallet Extension for Localhost

To ensure SubWallet shows all accounts when running the application on localhost:

1. **Open SubWallet Extension**:
   - Click on the SubWallet extension icon in your browser

2. **Access Settings**:
   - Go to Settings (gear icon)
   - Select "Manage Website Access"

3. **Find and Modify Localhost Permission**:
   - Look for `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` in the list
   - If not found, you may need to connect from your app first
   - Change the permission to "Allow reading all accounts"

4. **Enable "Web Authorization"**:
   - In Settings, make sure "Web Authorization" is turned on

5. **Reload Your Application**:
   - After changing permissions, fully reload your application

### Configuring Polkadot.js Extension for Localhost

If you're using the Polkadot.js extension:

1. **Open the Extension**:
   - Click on the Polkadot.js extension icon

2. **Access Settings**:
   - Click the settings icon (gear)

3. **Modify Global Settings**:
   - Toggle on "Allow authorization for all accounts"

4. **Set Website-Specific Permissions**:
   - Find "localhost" in the list of websites
   - Click "Manage website access"
   - Select all accounts you want to make available
   - Click "Allow"

## Authentication System

The application uses a multi-step authentication process:

1. **Wallet Connection**: User connects their Polkadot/Substrate wallet
2. **Whitelist Verification**: Server checks if the wallet address is allowed
3. **Signature Challenge**: User signs a unique message with their wallet
4. **JWT Issuance**: Upon successful verification, the server issues a JWT
5. **Session Management**: The JWT is stored locally for persistent sessions

### Public vs. Restricted Mode

- **Public Mode**: When `ALLOWED_WALLETS` is empty, any wallet can authenticate
- **Restricted Mode**: Only wallet addresses in the whitelist can authenticate

## API Endpoints

The application includes several API endpoints:

- `/api/auth/check-mode` - Check if the application is in public or restricted mode
- `/api/auth/validate-address` - Verify if a wallet address is allowed
- `/api/wallet` - Authenticate with wallet signature
- `/api/wallet/verify` - Verify JWT token

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Make your changes and test in the browser

3. Check for type errors:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

4. Format your code:

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

### Debugging

The application includes a debugging panel that can be enabled in development mode to help diagnose authentication issues. It shows the current authentication state and allows you to trigger actions.

## Authentication Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing authentication issues:

1. Ensure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
2. Verify that your wallet address is in the whitelist (if in restricted mode)
3. Check browser console for any errors during signature requests
4. Ensure the JWT_SECRET is properly set in your environment
5. Clear local storage and try again if problems persist

## Production Deployment

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Always keep your `JWT_SECRET` secure and unique per environment
- In production, use HTTPS to encrypt all communication
- Whitelist addresses are kept server-side for security
- Never commit .env files to version control
